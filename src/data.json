        "Thank you so much for creating this template. At first, I wasn't sure how this would help me. I'm only learning one language, but then I decide to use the 'Time Distribution' for the different skills (reading, listening, speaking,...) instead of languages and a whole new world opened up. It's so much fun to see how much time I can realistically spend on language learning and plan my week based on the info in that timetable.",
        "don't know if you know what you've just done here but this is GENIUS! The best part is I can personalize this template for not just language learning, but for all my learning. From instruments to coding (languages too) to school/course subjects...Thank you so so much!"
